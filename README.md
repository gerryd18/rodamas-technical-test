# Laravel Project Installation and Execution Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to install and run a Laravel project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:

-   [PHP](https://www.php.net/) (>= 7.3)
-   [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>= 12.x) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/))
-   [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

3. **Install PHP dependencies using Composer:**

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

4. **Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:**

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

5. **Generate application key:**

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

6. **Configure the database:**

    Update the `.env` file with your database credentials:

    ```plaintext
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
    DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
    DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
    ```

7. **Run database migrations and seed (if any):**

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate --seed
    ```

8. **Install front-end dependencies (if any):**

    ```bash
    npm install && npm run dev
    ```

## Running the Application

Once you've completed the installation steps:

1. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

2. **Access the application:**

    Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:8000` (or any other port specified by the `php artisan serve` command if you've customized it).

## Additional Notes

-   Make sure your server meets the [Laravel Server Requirements](https://laravel.com/docs/{{version}}/installation#server-requirements).
-   For production deployment, refer to the [Laravel Deployment Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/{{version}}/deployment).
-   Refer to the [Laravel Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/{{version}}) for more advanced usage and customization options.

That's it! You should now have a Laravel project up and running on your local machine. Happy coding! ðŸš€
